# D-ENGINE
D-ENGINE is a project developed by Norris Chiu (Sung Hong), Jack Hui (Shui Kit) and Lui Ka Fai.

D-ENGINE aims to be an open source deferred rendering game engine that is simple and easy to use, so users can learn native game programming with good exposure to the low level system, written by C++ and with core Direct3D API only from scratch.

A demo is included in the repository in the GameCode folder.

Notable features include:

<b>Graphics</b>
- Deferred shading and GBuffer
- Optimized light volume rendering with stenciling
- Custom effect classes as interfaces to GPU
- Bump, basic shadow mapping
- Screen space reflection approximation

<b>Animation</b>
- Skeletal animation implementation
- Animation State Machine
- Cross-fade blending

<b>Advanced shader</b>
- Geometry shader with stream-out supported particle system
- Terrain rendering with level of details tessellation

<b>Engine</b>
- Pool memory allocator with Handle
- Custom Handle array and hash map
- SIMD maths libraryâ€‹
- Game object component architecture
- Collision detection facilities
- Custom event queue and handler
- FBX asset exporter

# Building D-ENGINE
There are two ways to build the D-ENGINE and the provided demo.

1. Use the existing Microsoft Visual Studio Solution (.sln) directly.
2. Generate Microsoft Visual Studio Solution (.sln) from Premake script. For user with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, bring up the command prompt and run premake5.exe with the command "premake5 vs2015" at the base directory of DEngine. For further information on using and extending Premake, visit their official repository https://github.com/premake/premake-core.

*GameCode should be set as the start-up project, D-ENGINE currently support Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (v140 platform toolset is required) with Intel CPU only

# Roadmap
We planned to extend D-ENGINE in the following areas in the future:

1. Turn into a multi-threaded engine
2. Optimize GPU resources management
3. Optimize rendering with spatial data structure
4. Experiment with forward plus and other rendering technique
5. Add support for in game profiling
